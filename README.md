1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/shopping-app.git
cd shopping-app
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:

```properties
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://firaolteshale:3h8F2nJPcq4Yyitr@cluster0.bc25gmo.mongodb.net/Shop?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0
